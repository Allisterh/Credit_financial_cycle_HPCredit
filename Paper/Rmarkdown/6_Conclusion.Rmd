# CONCLUSION

In this paper, we use a correlated multivariate unobserved component model to examine the hypothesis about the role of household credit on house prices and vice versa. In doing so, we decompose the movements of the two variables of interest into a permanent and transitory component. The correlations among the cyclical components support the idea that the rise of household credit is associated with a house prices above it long-run trend. Our multivariate model captures the dynamics features of the household credit and house prices series and performs better than univariate benchmarks in capturing the boom and bust during the last two decades. Additionally, employing cross correlation effects on the transitory components of the two series allows me to test the predictive ability of the cyclical components and found evidence to support that a household credit gap can positively predict a house prices gap. These findings suggests macroprudential policy implication since house prices are increasingly becoming a more important topic.

Further development for this paper should include studying on policy implication of credit and house price gaps with high magnitudes, introducing more robust optimal constraints on parameters to ensure stability rather than an ad-hoc approach of selecting weights. Additional examination of the multicollinearity and identification issues also need to be addressed.
