# EMPIRICAL MODEL

## Model Specification
Our model is a bivariate extension of the model used in [@morley_slow_2007]. We will use a bivariate unobserved component model to model the dynamics in credit to household as ratio to GDP ($y_t$) and house prices index ($h_t$).

Each series is decomposed into a stochasted trend component ($\tau_{jt}, j = y, h$) and a cyclical component ($c_{jt}, j = y, h$) implying an $I(1)$ process for all the variables. The non-stationarity of these variables is confirmed by the unit root tests where we do not reject the null of unit root for all the variables. ^[The detailed results are not reported here for brevity. They are available upon request] In contrast to [@morley_slow_2007], we do not impose a common trend restriction. The two variables have their own trend and cycle components and these components are allowed to have a certain degree of correlation.

Secondly, we specify the dynamics of trend and cycle components. The cyclical component in each series is assumed to follow an AR(2) process, and in additional configurations, lags of the other series. This assumption captures the autocorrelation structures and provices rich dynamics in the data series to enable us to identify all the parameters under the state-space model framwork. ^[The cyclical dynamics in theory can also be modelled as VAR processes. The presence of cross-correlation among shocks and cross-cycle coefficients in our framework captures the cross-variable dynamics.] The trend components are assumed to follow a random walk process, and as mentioned above, we do not impose a common trend among the two variables.

Thirdly, we assume the shocks to the trend and cyclical components follow a white noise process, but allow for non-zero cross-correlation across series. The shocks to the trend components ($\eta_{jt}, j=y,h$) have a long-run effect on the trend because the trend is assumed to follow a random walk process. The shocks to the cyclical component ($\varepsilon_{jt}, j=y,h$) have a short-run effect on the cycle because the cycle follows a stationary autoregressive process with two lags. The shocks to each trend component are allowed to be correlated across each other, so are the shocks to the cyclical components. However, we impose the zero correlation between the shocks to the trend component and the shocks to the cycle component within and between series. That is to say, we assume that the shocks that generate a long-run effect are different from the shocks that generate a short-run effect. This assumption isolates the temporary shocks from permanent shocks. 

Regarding variance and covariance estimates, it should be pointed out that, in the variance-covariance matrix of the shocks the the trend and cycle, $\sigma_{\eta y \eta h}$  is the covariance of the shocks to the trend of credit to household as percentage of GDP and house prices index, whereas $\sigma_{\varepsilon y \varepsilon h}$ is the covariance of the shocks to the cycles component of the two variables. The estimates of correlation coefficients, instead of covariances, will be reported in Table 4 and Table 5. We estimate the model using the classical maximum likelihood via the Kalman Filter.^[See [@kim_state-space_1999] and [@durbin_time_2012] for the details of the estimation procedure.]

## Parameters constraints

A minor novel contribution of the paper is the introduction of a technique to constraint model parameters in feasible stationary regions by imposing penalties on magnitudes of stationary components, configuring a feasible estimation procedure for the Unobserved Component model has been a difficult challenge of using the model.

The estimation of the unobserved component model uses a nonlinear log-likelihood function maximization in [@morley_slow_2007]. Estimating this function requires a stationary constraint using numerical optimization, this method is prone to produce corner solutions that are not meaningful.

I did not put stationary constraints directly on the autoregressive parameters. Since such constraints on a VAR(2) system is complex to set up. However, to achieve feasible stationary transitory measurement, I implement an additional term on the objective function:

```{=latex}
\begin{align}
l(\theta) = -w1\sum_{t=1}^{T}ln\lbrack(2\pi)^2|f_{t|t-1}|\rbrack
-w2\sum_{t=1}^{T}\eta'_{t|t-1}f^{-1}_{t|t-1}\eta_{t|t-1}
- w3*\sum_{t=1}^{T}(c_{yt}^2) + w4*\sum_{t=1}^{T}(c_{ht}^2)
\end{align}
```

The last term in the objective function acts as a penalty against too much transitory deviation from zero. Without this penalty, the trend would be linear or all the movements in the measured series would be matched by transitory movements.

Regarding constraints on covariance matrix, I applied the same constraints as in Morley 2007 to imply for positive-definite covariance matrix.
