# INTRODUCTION
The Great Recession caused researchers to shift their focus on the narrative of credit, housing market and financial stability. However, the debate on whether house prices have been the main driving source of the credit cycle, or financial conditions (credit) are the main determinants of house price cycle is still open. One strand of literature has argued that increase in credit supply played a major role in the boom and the subsequent bust in the housing market in the U.S. Another strand of literature has argued that credit supply itself can't explain the big swings in house prices and have attributed beliefs and other unobserved characteristics as a major source of house price variations. At the same time, some researchers have argued that credit booms are preceded and sometimes driven by housing booms. The increase in collateral and relaxation of banks' funding constraint leads to an increase in the willingness of the banking sector to provide funding not only to the residential sector, but also commercial real estate as well as overall funding to the businesses. 
Most of the work in the literature has considered the relationship between house prices and credit separately, that is, if house prices are affected by credit or changes in house prices affect credit. It is perfectly reasonable to assume that house prices and credit have a dynamic relationship and the causality does not necessarily run from one variable to another. The novel contribution of this study is to develop a model to jointly examine the two variables of interest: household credit and house prices and their interaction. In particular, we pay attention to the long-run and short-run movements in credit and house prices and model their joint dynamics. **In doing so, we use data from two countries: the US and the UK**. The methodology that I use in this paper to extract transitory and permanent information from non-stationary time series is a decomposition method called Unobserved Components model pioneered by [@beveridge_new_1981]. The implementation details of the methodology is inspired by [@morley_slow_2007] and [@huang_rise_2019].  This method allows the permanent component to be shown as a random walk and the transitory component to be a stationary process with mean zero. The stationary transitory component configuration is important to infer meaningful structural linkage between the two variables of interest: household credit and house prices; as non-stationary transitory components do not offer meaningful inferences. This brings up the paper's second novel contribution to the literature. By explicitly configuring cross correlation coefficients on the cyclical components of the two variables, we will be able to examine the predictive ability of the cycles. This would produce a much desired inference for macro-prudential policy implication to stabilize the macroeconomy.

**Using sample data from the US and the UK,** We find interesting and meaningful results from the estimated multivariated correlated unobserved component model. The maximum-likelihood estimates of our correlated multivariate UC model suggest that there is a strong positive correlation between the transitory shock to household credit and the transitory shock to the house prices index. This suggests that a temporary increase in household credit is associated with an increase in house prices above its long-run level. These results support the narrative evidence on the strong relationship between household credit and house prices. More importantly, we also find evidence that lags of household credit cycle has predictive ability in forecasting the magnitude of house prices gap above its long-run level by examining the cross correlation coefficient on the cyclical components. We also find that the trend-cycle decomposition of the two variables of interest captures the recent boom and bust behavior and compares favorably to a univariate trend-cycle decomposition benchmark. In particular, we find that the house prices and household credit were significantly higher than its long-term trend before the financial crisis and then there was an overreaction during the crisis leading the house price and credit cycle to a negative territory implying that house prices and credit were below their long-run trend. The magnitude of the model's cyclical components for both house price and credit during this time of crisis is significantly higher than that of  other univariate decomposition models' such as the HP filter and the VAR unobserved component model.

Finally, our sample data show that the correlation between house price and credit is much higher in the UK than in the US as shown in Table 1. This help testing the robustness of our model. **The plan of the paper is as followed, in section 2 we will introduce the summary of data and their description. In section 3, we will lay out the details of the decomposition methodology using unobserved component model with vector auto-regression (VAR). In section 4, we will go over results of the model regression and our interpretation. In section 5, we will test the robustness of the model by comparing the results against some traditional methods of analyzing time series data. And lastly, in section 6, we will give our conclusion remark for the model.**

# LITERATURE REVIEW

There has been an increasing interest in the study of the interaction between credit, speculation and house prices [@mian_house_2011; @mian_credit_2018], [@kishor_forecasting_2020], [@guerrieri_housing_2016] and [@davis_housing_2015] have detailed literature reviews on the dynamics between housing market and credit conditions. We will list the four literatures branches that study the dynamics of the credit cycles, housing prices cycles and then the key connection between boom-bust episodes in housing markets and boom-bust episodes in credit markets. There are two approaches to this interaction:(i) The house price cycles generates the credit cycles. (ii) The credit cycles generates the house price cycles.

**One strand of the literature** focuses on how credit cycles are generated. [@kiyotaki_credit_1997] modeled the fluctuation of credit condition due to credit limit and asset prices. The model shows how exogenous shocks can create cyclical fluctuation in credit, asset prices and real output. [@myerson_model_2012] proposed a model of credit cycles generated by moral hazard in dynamic interactions among different generations of financial agents. [@guerrieri_housing_2016] used a catastrophe model for credit, in which multiple equilibria are possible due to adverse selection: as credit increases, the composition of borrowers worsens at this can generate a crash in credit market. [@boissay_booms_2016] studied the topic of endogenous boom and bust in credit market using a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model, in which moral hazard and asymmetric information may endogenously lead to sudden freezes and crises in the credit market. As for classifying periods of booms and bursts in credit condition, [@alessi_identifying_2018] used a random forest model to identify unsustainable credit growth periods.

The second branch of the literature focuses on dynamics of house prices changes. We first look at the generation of momentum in house price changes. Asset prices valuation tend to vary when information about their performance is available. [@thaler_chapter_2005] pointed out that securities with good performance records receive extremely high valuations, and those valuation will return to the mean on average. [@hong_unified_1999] suggested a model with information diffuses gradually across the population, and if agents implement simple univariate strategies, their attempts at arbitrage will lead to overreaction at long horizons. [@capozza_anatomy_2004] analyzed dynamic properties of markets exhibiting serial correlation and mean reversion. These properties allows for prices to overshoot equilibrium (cycles) and diverge permanently from equilibirum. [@glaeser_housing_2008] incorporated housing supply elasticity into the analysis of housing prices momentum and shows that the price run-ups of the 1980s were almost exclusively experienced in cities with more inelastic housing supply. [@head_search_2014] showed that variation in the time it takes to sell houses induces transaction prices to exhibit serially correlated growth. [@glaeser_extrapolative_2017] modeled the  leads house prices expectation approximation to display missing features in rational models: momentum at short run horizon, mean reversion in long run horizon and excess longer-term volatility relative to fundamentals.  [@kishor_time_2015] studied the U.S. housing market by using a combination of Unobserved Component model and GARCH model to study the time-varying importance of permanent and transitory housing components in the U.S. housing prices. [@knoll_no_2017] constructed a house price index for 14 economies in over 140 years. They argue that real house prices have largely followed a "hockey stick" pattern: fairly consistent for a long period of time, then followed by a pronounced increase towards the second half of the century with substantial cross-country variation. Furthermore, they say that most of the price increase can be attributed to the increase in the price of land, and that house prices have risen faster than income in recent decades. [@knoll_return_2016] argued that rise in house prices coincides with a rise the the price-rent ratio, a fundamental that shows intrinsic value of housing. 

**Another branch of literature** is the one that studies the hypothesis that house price cycles generates the credit cycles. The dynamics of houses price on household credit can be viewed through the lens of the borrower balance sheet. [@bernanke_agency_1989] developed a  neoclassical model of the business cycle in which the condition of borrowers' balance sheets is a source of output dynamics. The mechanism is that higher borrower net worth reduces the agency costs of financing real capital investments. The financial acceleration effects implies that stronger balance sheets due to higher asset prices will lead to lower cost of borrowing to invest. Which suggests that a boom in housing prices will lead to a boom in credit. [@kiyotaki_credit_1997] further incorporated this positive feedback through asset prices, and the associated intertemporal multiplier process that affect borrowing capacity and output into their paper. An increase in home equity due to increase in house prices will allow borrower to borrow more to finance either personal consumption or more speculation housing investment. [@mian_credit_2018]  showed that the crash in the housing market and following credit crunch showed the importance of housing prices for household balance sheet as well as banking sector balance sheet.

**There are papers that have studied** the hypothesis that credit cycles generates house price cycles. [@agnello_booms_2011],  [@agnello_economic_2018] examined different variables that are likely to create a bubble in housing markets. First is the effect of credit constraint on house prices. [@stein_prices_1995] is the first paper to explore the effects of down-payment requirements on house price volatility. The paper highlighted the self-reinforcing effect that runs from house prices to down payments and housing demand, back to house prices. If house prices decline, the value of households' collateral declines, depressing housing demand and hence pushing house prices further down. This multiplier effect can generate multiple equilibria and accounts for the house price boom-bust episodes. The self-reinforcing effect has the same spirit of the transmission mechanism put forth by [@kiyotaki_credit_1997]. In a recent related paper, [@ortalo-magne_housing_2006] showed that income volatility of young households or relaxation of their credit constraints can explain excess volatility of house prices through identifying a powerful driver of the housing market: the ability of young households to afford the down payment on a starter home. 

**Another research branch has also explored the** effect of financial innovation, or financial liberalization on house prices.  [@kermani_cheap_2012] proposed a model to emphasize the importance of financial liberalization and its reversal to explain the housing boom and bust. [@he_housing_2015] also proposed a model where housing collateralizes loans and house price boom and bust can be generated by financial innovation because the liquidity premium on housing is non-monotone in the loan-to-equity ratio. [@huo_financial_2016] had a model with heterogenous households, housing and credit constraints, and also show that financial shocks can generate large drops in housing prices. [@favilukis_international_2012] studied the impact of systemic changes in housing finance: changes in housing collateral requirements and the change in borrowing costs (the spread of mortgage rates over risk-free security) on how these factors affect risk premiums in housing markets, and how those risk premiums in turn affect home prices.[@favilukis_macroeconomic_2017] developed a quantitative general equilibirum model with housing and collateral constraints to explore what drives fluctuations in house prices to rent ratio. They propose that a relaxation of financing constraints leads to a large boom in house prices. And the boom in house prices is entirely the result of a decline in the housing risk premium. [@mian_credit_2018] showed that speculation is a critical channel through which credit supply expansion affects the housing cycle. 

**After the financial crisis, there has also been an explosion of interest on the effect** of credit expansion on house prices. [@justiniano_credit_2019] argued that loosening of the collateral requirements alone cannot explain the recent housing boom in the US, but there must have been an expansion in the credit supply. The authors argued that house prices rose from 2000 to 2007 without an expansion of leverage. The cause that lead to the housing boom before recession was because of an increase in credit supply or available funds rather than an increase in leverage. The rates of mortgages to real estate remained constant. This contradict with the popular view that attributes the housing boom to looser borrowing constraints associated with lower collateral requirements, which would shift the demand for credit. In short, the increase in supply of credit was the cause of housing boom. Beyond 2007, the paper argues that there was an increase in collateralizing houses relative to available funds, or that available funds for lending decreased, leading to a rise in mortgage rates and a collapse of house prices. More interestingly, Jorda, Schularick and Taylor have studied the interplay between credit cycles, house price cycles and economic performance in a series of papers. [@schularick_credit_2012] created a new data sets for 14 developed countries over 140 years and showed how credit growth is a powerful predictor of financial crises. [@jorda_great_2016] claimed that mortgage lending booms were loosely related to financial crisis before WWII, but have become a more important predictor of financial fragility after. The share of mortgages on banks' balance sheets doubled in the later half of twentieth century, driven by a rise of mortgage lending to households. Household debt to asset ratios have risen substantially in many countries in the study. Financial stability risks have been linked to real estate lending booms.[@jorda_betting_2015] claim that there has been an increase in the mentality of "bets on the house" in the past century. Mortgage credit has risen dramatically as a share of banks' balance sheets from about one third at the beginning of the last century, to about two thirds nowadays. They use a novel IV local projection methods to demonstrate that loose monetary conditions lead to booms in real estate and house prices' bubbles. These in turn leads to higher risk of financial crises. Mortgage booms and house price bubbles have been closely associated with a higher likelihood of a financial crisis.[@jorda_macrofinancial_2017] claimed that a century-long and stable ratio of credit to GDP gave way to rapid financialization and surging leverage in the last forty years. This coincide with a shifts in foundational macroeconomic relationships. More financialized economies exhibit more tail risk, as well as tighter real-real and real-financial correlations, including of course the credit and real estate correlation. The paper also show that both real house prices and mortgages in 17 sample countries display a "hockey stick" in their patterns. Meaning they both stay stable for a long period of time before ticking up drastically at the end of the sample. It can be shown that house price growth and mortgage growth generally co-move. [@favara_credit_2015] showed an expansion in mortgage credit has significant effects on house prices using a spatial IV-strategy with the US branching deregulation between 1994 and 2005 as an instrument for credit. The treated banks credit expansion lead to increases in housing demand. [@di_maggio_credit-induced_2017] showed that a credit expansion can generate a boom and bust in house prices and real activity. The paper use the exploitation of the same federal deregulation in preemption of local laws against predatory lending in 2004 to gauge the effect of the supply of credit on the real economy.

However, the debate on whether house prices have been the main driving source of the credit cycle, or financial conditions (credit) are the main driving force of house price cycle is still open. In this paper, **I will use** a dynamic model in order to be able explain the relationship between these two variables in both short-term and long-term.
